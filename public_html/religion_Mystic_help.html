MYSTIC
<BR>
<BR>The mind.  It is the most powerful weapon in the world.  To those who know
<BR>it's secrets.  Harnessing powers beyond comprehension to many, you are able
<BR>to invoke columns of flame, conjure fields of energy to shield you from
<BR>harm, or even take control of another's mind.  There seems no limit to what
<BR>you are capable of, but it is not without price.  You have dedicated your
<BR>life on the study of the mystic, all things arcane and divine.  Whatever the
<BR>source, this power has come through years of hard work, and diligent study. 
<BR>Your chambers are lined with tomes and ancient texts, but your mind has
<BR>remembered all of their contents.  
<BR>
<BR>The Way of the Mystic is often a path of loneliness, it's members more often
<BR>caressing a book, or spending their nights in the company of a scroll lit by
<BR>a candle.  Their existence is focused on the assimilation of all things
<BR>arcane.  They have done their research, attended their lectures, and
<BR>sometimes have been given the gifts directly from the Gods themselves.  With
<BR>their wisdom fresh on the mind, they use this knowledge to exercise their
<BR>will.
