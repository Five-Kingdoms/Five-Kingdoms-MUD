<BR>Liars, cheaters, and stealers of Mirlan unite and rejoice, for there is
<BR>finally a path in which you can follow in life.  Your tricks and pranks
<BR>finally make way for purpose and reason and you are finally accepted for
<BR>what you do in life.  So gamble and drink, lie and steal, murder and purge! 
<BR>
<BR>For on this path, no one judges you, but Chance.
