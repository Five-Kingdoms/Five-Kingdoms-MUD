TRANQUILITY
<BR>
<BR>You have never hefted a weapon against another before and you aren't about
<BR>to start now.  There are many reasons why people like you exist.  Either
<BR>your respect for life is to great to bring an end to another's, or merely
<BR>the notion that violence accomplishes nothing, except reducing yourself to
<BR>the level of the enemy.  Differences can be resolved through talk, or other
<BR>means, but violence begets violence, and fighting with swords and magic only
<BR>produces more.  
<BR>
<BR>There are many means to achieve a goal.  One need not force it with the
<BR>point of a dagger, or the head of a mace.  Those who do so are foolish, and
<BR>see only an easy means to an end.  But life is not always the flattest road;
<BR>there are infinite hills and turns that one must negotiate to reach the end
<BR>of it.  There is work ahead for he who wishes to eliminate evil, whether
<BR>those who walk this path attempt to quell the ways of the wicked with words,
<BR>or simply perform so many acts of generosity that evil has no room to exist.
