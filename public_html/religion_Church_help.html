CHURCH 
<BR>
<BR>There are some who call you a fool for your steadfast devotion to an unseen
<BR>entity.  Let them talk, it makes no difference to you.  You have felt the
<BR>the touch of a God upon your soul, and you there is no denying that.  They
<BR>will see the follies of their ways, when they pass from this world.  The One
<BR>has been with you all of your life.  When you uttered your first words, He
<BR>was there moving your lips.  The first time you cast a spell, he imparted
<BR>his essence into you and made the incantations bear fruit.  Your eyes are
<BR>open, you may not see him, but you see his might in everything you behold.  
<BR>
<BR>The Church of the One relies on faith placed blindly.  Only by venerating
<BR>that which you've no proof truly exists, you demonstrate your devotion. 
<BR>Only then can true power be felt.  The cynics say that the unseen, unfelt,
<BR>and unheard does not exist, rather venerating that which can be experienced
<BR>directly.  But just because one cannot see the air does not mean it does not
<BR>exist, you must simply accept it as truth.  Let the sheep graze mindlessly
<BR>in the field, but when the time for the shearing comes, you will not be left
<BR>out in the cold.
