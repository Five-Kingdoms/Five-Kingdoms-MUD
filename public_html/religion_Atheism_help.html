ATHEISM
<BR>
<BR>Gods...  You have seen these 'Gods' running around like they own the joint. 
<BR>Nothing more than you...  Except maybe a tad bit stronger.  Theirs is a
<BR>power that anyone can achieve.  You've seen it before, you'll no doubt see
<BR>it again.  It's just a matter of time.  Some alchemical formula?  Maybe once
<BR>you have perfected skill with every known weapon?  Who knows?  It is the
<BR>next stage of life.  It just has to be attained.  
<BR>
<BR>With each passing year, every mortal gets more and more powerful.  And so it
<BR>is with the Gods.  They're nothing more than everyone else.  They just have
<BR>found the secrets, and moved on.  Was not everyone a child once?  And when
<BR>they were, did not your father seem immortal?  Of course.  You have just
<BR>grown up.  In the cosmic scheme of things, you are still but a child, and to
<BR>get to the higher plateau, you just have to grow up again.
