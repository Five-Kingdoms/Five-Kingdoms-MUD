NECROPSY
<BR>
<BR>Everyone has their hobby.  As a youth, you can remember poking the dead
<BR>bird you found with a stick, fixated on the concept of dead things.  You
<BR>matured, but so did your pre-occupation with the lifeless.  Prodding sticks
<BR>turned to laboratory equipment as your thirst for knowledge of death
<BR>changed to an obsession.  You have searched for years for thick dusty tomes
<BR>and ancient molded manuscripts, and your labor has rewarded you well.
<BR>you know many things that none else do, and soon...  Soon the means to
<BR>escape death shall be yours.
<BR>
<BR>It would seem that every path of magic possesses its own sages, and the
<BR>path of Death is no exception.  Those who wield it's terrible powers
<BR>do so for many reasons.  Perhaps they seek a way to cheat death.  To become
<BR>undying.  Or maybe they just have grown too weary of mortal companionship
<BR>and seek to raise the dead and make their own friend.  Whatever the
<BR>reasons, there is no doubting that their work has paid off, and knowledge
<BR>truly is power.
